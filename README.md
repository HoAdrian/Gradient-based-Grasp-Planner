# Gradient-based Grasp planner (developed by Shing Hei Ho (Adrian))
- The grasp planner iteratively refines an initial grasp pose to maximize/minimize deformation of an object

# Stress Net (developed by Bao Thach)
- predict stress and deformation field of an object given partial-view point cloud and grasp pose
